index.instruction.title = Instruction for Solarpi series products
index.instruction.intro = 1) All the Solarpi C type all-in-one machine should be placed in the shade and avoid direct sunlight, high temperature, and corrosive gas environment.<br>2) Solarpi C type all-in-one machine should avoid the impact and violent vibration environment.<br>3) Solar energy panels should be placed on the outside where the sun is illuminated. The panels should be placed as far as possible perpendicular with the sunlight to reach the best power output. The panels should avoid occlusion and shadow.<br>4) The panel surface should avoid direct impact and transport gently.<br>5) When the red light is on which means the battery capacity is insufficient, the power output will stop and the electric appliances will not working. This is not the case of equipment failure. Please connect the solar energy panels for charging until the yellow light is on.
